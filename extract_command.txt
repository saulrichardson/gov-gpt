Run the batch extractor with 8 parallel workers (default):

    python -m llm_pipeline.batch_extract sections.db -j 8

You can specify one or more documentation root directories after the database path.  Example for two custom folders using 4 workers:

    python -m llm_pipeline.batch_extract sections.db ./docs ./extra_specs -j 4

The extractor requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment and the `openai` package installed.
